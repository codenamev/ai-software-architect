# Architecture Considerations

This document outlines the key architectural considerations for the AI Software Architect framework.

## Core Principles

1. **Multi-Assistant Support**: The framework is designed to work with multiple AI coding assistants (Claude, Cursor, Codex) through standardized configuration.

2. **Architectural Documentation**: A central repository of architecture decisions, reviews, and recalibration plans provides a single source of truth.

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: The architecture supports incremental improvement through structured reviews and recalibration.

4. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Assistant-specific configurations are isolated in `.coding-assistants/` subdirectories
   - Architecture documentation is maintained in `.architecture/` directory
   - Implementation details are separate from architectural decisions

## Design Decisions

1. **Standardized Documentation**: All architecture documents follow consistent formats to ensure readability and maintainability.

2. **Version-Controlled Architecture**: Architecture documents are version-controlled alongside code.

3. **Assistant-Specific Configurations**: Each AI coding assistant has dedicated configuration in its own format and directory.

4. **Shared Understanding**: All assistants reference the same underlying architecture documentation.

## Evolution Strategy

The architecture will evolve through:

1. Formal architecture reviews
2. Structured recalibration processes
3. Version-to-version comparisons
4. Ongoing refinement of assistant configurations

Any significant changes to this architecture should be documented in the appropriate review and recalibration documents.
