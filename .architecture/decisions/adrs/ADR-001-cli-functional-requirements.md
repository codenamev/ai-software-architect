# ADR-001: CLI Tool Functional Requirements

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The AI Software Architect framework provides a structured approach to implementing rigorous software architecture practices in any project. Currently, implementing this framework requires manual copying of files and customization. To streamline adoption and ensure consistency, a command line interface (CLI) tool is needed to automate the setup process.

This ADR defines the functional requirements for the CLI tool that will analyze an existing git repository and generate appropriate architecture files tailored to the specific codebase.

## Decision Drivers

* Reduce friction for new project adoption
* Ensure consistent implementation across different projects
* Accommodate diverse project types and structures
* Support customization without sacrificing framework integrity
* Enable AI assistants to effectively work with the architecture framework

## Decision

Create a CLI tool with the following functional requirements:

### 1. Repository Analysis

* **Codebase Scanning**: Analyze the repository's structure, languages, and frameworks
* **Style Detection**: Identify documentation style, naming conventions, and code organization patterns
* **Existing Architecture**: Detect any existing architectural documentation or patterns

### 2. Framework Installation

* **Directory Creation**: Set up the `.architecture` directory with appropriate subdirectories
* **Template Generation**: Create customized templates that match the project's style
* **Configuration**: Generate initial configuration files with sensible defaults

### 3. Content Generation

* **Member Profiles**: Create the `members.yml` file with appropriate review roles based on project type
* **Principles Document**: Generate initial architectural principles aligned with detected code patterns
* **ADR Templates**: Provide starter ADRs customized to the project's domain and technology stack
* **Review Template**: Customize the architecture review template for the project's needs

### 4. AI Assistant Integration

* **Assistant Configuration**: Set up `.coding-assistants` directory with configurations for various AI tools
* **Documentation Links**: Ensure cross-references between assistant configurations and architecture docs
* **Command Suggestions**: Generate examples of prompts for working with the architecture framework

### 5. User Interaction

* **Interactive Mode**: Guide users through setup with intelligent defaults and customization options
* **Non-Interactive Mode**: Support CI/CD usage with configuration file and command line options
* **Validation**: Verify that generated files are consistent and properly formatted
* **Documentation**: Provide clear usage instructions and examples

## Consequences

### Positive

* Significantly reduces the barrier to adopting the architecture framework
* Ensures consistent implementation across projects
* Tailors the framework to fit the specific needs of each project
* Provides a foundation for automated architecture checks and validations
* Improves the experience of working with AI assistants on architecture

### Negative

* Introduces another tool to maintain
* May make incorrect assumptions about project structure
* Could generate templates that don't perfectly match project needs

### Neutral

* Shifts focus from manual customization to tool configuration
* Creates a dependency on the CLI for optimal setup

## Implementation

**Phase 1: Core Analysis and Generation**
* Implement repository analysis for common languages and frameworks
* Create basic directory structure and file generation
* Develop interactive command line interface

**Phase 2: Customization and Enhancement**
* Add support for detecting project-specific patterns
* Implement more sophisticated template customization
* Create assistant-specific configuration generation

**Phase 3: Integration and Automation**
* Add CI/CD support
* Implement validation and verification features
* Create update and migration capabilities

## Alternatives Considered

### Manual Setup with Documentation

**Pros:**
* No additional tool dependencies
* Maximum flexibility for customization

**Cons:**
* Higher barrier to adoption
* Inconsistent implementation across projects
* More time-consuming to set up

### Web-based Generator

**Pros:**
* Potentially more user-friendly interface
* Could provide visual previews of generated files

**Cons:**
* Requires server infrastructure or relies on third-party services
* More complex to develop and maintain
* Less suitable for integration with local development workflows

## Validation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] CLI can analyze repositories in at least 5 common languages/frameworks
- [ ] Generated files follow the AI Software Architect framework standards
- [ ] Setup process takes less than 5 minutes for a typical project
- [ ] Generated files require minimal manual adjustment
- [ ] AI assistants can effectively work with the generated architecture framework

**Testing Approach:**
* Unit tests for analysis and generation components
* Integration tests with sample repositories of various types
* User testing with both experienced and new architecture framework users
