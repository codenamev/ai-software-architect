## Implementation Approach

### Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes

The initial version (0.1.0) will establish the foundation, with subsequent releases adding features in a non-breaking manner. We'll maintain backward compatibility through:

- Stable CLI interface with new commands rather than changing existing ones
- Configuration defaults that preserve backward compatibility
- Feature flags for new capabilities that might change behavior

### Feature Flags

| Flag Name | Purpose | Default Value | Removal Version |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| enable_advanced_analysis | Enable deeper code analysis features | false | 0.3.0 |
| enable_ai_metadata | Generate AI-readable metadata | false | 0.3.0 |
| enable_visualization | Generate architecture visualizations | false | 0.4.0 |
| enable_plugins | Support for external plugins | false | 0.3.0 |

### Migration Support

- Version 0.2.0 will include utilities to update artifacts generated by 0.1.0
- Version 0.3.0 will provide migration paths for both 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 artifacts
- All migrations will preserve user customizations when possible

## Testing Strategy

### Component Tests

- Each component will have comprehensive unit tests
- Interface contracts will be tested for all implementations
- Mock implementations will be used to isolate components

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end tests will verify complete workflows
- Sample repositories of various types will be used as test fixtures
- Cross-component interaction will be tested with real implementations

### Migration Tests

- Tests will verify that artifacts from previous versions can be properly updated
- User customizations will be included in migration test scenarios

## Documentation Plan

| Document | Update Required | Responsible | Deadline |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| CLI Usage Guide | Create initial version | TBD | 0.1.0 release |
| Plugin Development Guide | Create for plugin SDK | TBD | 0.2.0 release |
| Architecture Framework Integration | Create initial version | TBD | 0.1.0 release |
| Template Customization Guide | Create for customization system | TBD | 0.2.0 release |
| AI Assistant Integration | Create initial version | TBD | 0.2.0 release |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Inaccurate repository analysis | High | Medium | Conservative analysis with user confirmation for uncertain results |
| Performance issues with large repositories | Medium | High | Incremental analysis and progress reporting |
| Generated artifacts require significant manual adjustment | High | Medium | Template customization capabilities and validation system |
| Plugin system creates compatibility issues | Medium | Low | Strict plugin interface contracts and version compatibility checks |
| Security issues with repository analysis | High | Low | Path filtering, sensitive file detection, and user confirmation |
