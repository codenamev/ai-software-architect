# Architectural Recalibration Process

This document outlines the process for translating architectural review findings into updated plans, documentation, and implementation priorities. The recalibration process ensures that each new version incorporates lessons learned and establishes clear quality standards and direction for future development.

## Process Overview

The architectural recalibration process consists of the following steps, to be performed after each architectural review:

1. **Review Analysis & Prioritization** (Week 1)
2. **Architectural Plan Update** (Week 2)
3. **Documentation Refresh** (Week 3)
4. **Implementation Roadmapping** (Week 4)
5. **Progress Tracking** (Ongoing)

## 1. Review Analysis & Prioritization

**Goal**: Distill review findings into clear, actionable items with assigned priorities and owners.

**Activities**:
- Conduct a post-review meeting with key stakeholders (core contributors, architects, and domain representatives)
- Extract all recommendations from the review document
- Categorize recommendations into:
  - Architectural changes (structure, components, interfaces)
  - Implementation improvements (code-level concerns)
  - Documentation enhancements
  - Process adjustments
- Assign priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) to each item
- Assign ownership for each item to a specific team member or working group
- Document decisions in a "Recalibration Plan" file in `.architecture/recalibration/[version].md`

**Output**: Prioritized action item list with owners and target versions

## 2. Architectural Plan Update

**Goal**: Update the architectural documentation to reflect the accepted recommendations and new direction.

**Activities**:
- Create or update architectural decision records (ADRs) for major changes
- Revise component diagrams and interaction models
- Update architectural principles document if needed
- Create migration plans for deprecated components or interfaces
- Document technical debt items that were identified but won't be immediately addressed
- Update the architectural roadmap for the next 2-3 versions

**Output**: Updated architectural documentation including:
- Revised architecture diagrams
- New/updated ADRs
- Updated architectural principles
- Technical debt inventory
- Architectural roadmap

## 3. Documentation Refresh

**Goal**: Ensure all documentation accurately reflects the new architectural direction.

**Activities**:
- Update README.md and high-level documentation
- Revise API documentation to reflect interface changes
- Create or update examples that demonstrate new architectural patterns
- Update developer guides with new best practices
- Create migration guides for breaking changes
- Update code documentation to reflect architectural changes

**Output**: Comprehensive, consistent documentation aligned with the new architectural direction

## 4. Implementation Roadmapping

**Goal**: Create detailed implementation plans for architectural changes across upcoming versions.

**Activities**:
- Break down architectural changes into implementable tasks
- Group tasks into logical milestones
- Assign tasks to specific versions based on dependencies and priorities
- Identify test coverage needs for new or changed components
- Create acceptance criteria for architectural changes
- Document implementation approach for complex changes

**Output**: Version-specific implementation roadmaps with tasks, dependencies, and acceptance criteria

## 5. Progress Tracking

**Goal**: Continuously monitor implementation progress and adjust plans as needed.

**Activities**:
- Create tracking tickets for all architectural changes
- Establish regular check-in meetings to review progress
- Update the recalibration status document monthly
- Record completed architectural changes with version numbers
- Document any deviations from the original plan with justifications
- Assess the impact of completed changes on overall architecture
- Update architectural documentation as changes are implemented

**Output**: Up-to-date progress tracking and documentation of architectural evolution

## Version-to-Version Comparison

After each major or minor version release, create a version comparison document (`.architecture/comparisons/[old_version]-[new_version].md`) that:

1. Lists all architectural changes implemented in the release
2. Provides before/after diagrams for significant changes
3. Summarizes the impact of changes on:
   - Developer experience
   - Performance characteristics
   - Security posture
   - Maintainability metrics
   - Observability capabilities
4. Identifies any review recommendations that were deferred or modified during implementation
5. Provides guidance on adapting existing code to the new architecture

## Templates

The following templates are used in the recalibration process:

1. [Recalibration Plan Template](./.architecture/templates/recalibration_plan.md)
2. [Architectural Decision Record Template](./.architecture/templates/adr.md)
3. [Version Comparison Template](./.architecture/templates/version_comparison.md)
4. [Implementation Roadmap Template](./.architecture/templates/implementation_roadmap.md)
5. [Progress Tracking Template](./.architecture/templates/progress_tracking.md)

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Architecture Lead**: Coordinates the overall recalibration process
- **Component Owners**: Responsible for specific architectural components
- **Documentation Lead**: Ensures all documentation is updated consistently
- **Implementation Lead**: Coordinates implementation of architectural changes
- **Quality Assurance**: Validates that implemented changes meet architectural requirements
- **Release Manager**: Ensures architectural changes are properly included in releases
