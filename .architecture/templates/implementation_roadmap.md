# Implementation Roadmap for Version X.Y.Z

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for architectural changes identified in the recalibration plan for version X.Y.Z. It breaks down high-level architectural changes into implementable tasks, assigns them to specific versions, and establishes acceptance criteria.

## Target Versions

This roadmap covers the following versions:
- **X.Y.Z**: [Brief description of focus]
- **X.Y.(Z+1)**: [Brief description of focus]
- **X.(Y+1).0**: [Brief description of focus]

## Implementation Areas

### [Area 1: e.g., Component Decomposition]

**Overall Goal**: [Describe the high-level architectural goal for this area]

#### Tasks for Version X.Y.Z

| Task ID | Description | Dependencies | Complexity | Owner | Tests Required |
|---------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------|----------------|
| [A1.1] | [Detailed task description] | [Dependencies] | [Low/Medium/High] | [Owner] | [Test requirements] |
| [A1.2] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] |

**Acceptance Criteria**:

## Implementation Approach

### Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes

[Describe the approach to handling breaking changes, including deprecation policy, backward compatibility strategies, etc.]

### Feature Flags

[Document any feature flags that will be used to control the rollout of new architectural components]

| Flag Name | Purpose | Default Value | Removal Version |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| [Flag name] | [Purpose] | [true/false] | [Version] |

### Migration Support

[Detail any migration utilities, scripts, or guidance that will be provided to help users adapt to architectural changes]

## Testing Strategy

### Component Tests

[Describe the approach to testing individual architectural components]

### Integration Tests

[Describe the approach to testing integration between components]

### Migration Tests

[Describe the approach to testing migration paths from previous versions]

## Documentation Plan

| Document | Update Required | Responsible | Deadline |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|----------|
| [Document name] | [Description of update needed] | [Responsible person] | [Date] |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| [Risk description] | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation approach] |

## Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date | Dependencies | Owner |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| [Milestone description] | [Date] | [Dependencies] | [Owner] |
