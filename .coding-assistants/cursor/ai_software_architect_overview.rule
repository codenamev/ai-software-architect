# AI Software Architect Overview

AI Software Architect is a framework for organizing and structuring software architecture design with support for multiple AI coding assistants. It provides a structured approach to architecture documentation and decision-making.

## Key Principles

The framework follows these key principles:

1. **Architecture Documentation**: Central repository of architecture decisions and reviews in `.architecture/`
2. **Coding Assistant Integration**: Support for multiple AI coding assistants in `.coding-assistants/`
3. **Structured Review Process**: Formalized approach to architecture reviews and recalibration
4. **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Reviews from specialized architectural roles
5. **Implementation Planning**: Concrete plans for architectural improvements

## Core Components

- **ADRs**: Lightweight, structured documentation of architectural decisions
- **Architecture Reviews**: Multi-perspective analysis of architecture
- **Recalibration Plans**: Action items for implementing changes
- **Specialized Roles**: Different architectural perspectives (security, performance, etc.)

Refer to the central architecture documentation in the `.architecture/` directory for definitive information on the system design.
