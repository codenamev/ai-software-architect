# AI Software Architect Reviews

This rule explains how to conduct architecture reviews using the AI Software Architect framework.

## Review Types

The framework supports several types of architecture reviews:

1. **Version Reviews**: Comprehensive reviews tied to version releases
   - Format: `.architecture/reviews/1-0-0.md` (using version number)
   - Used for major releases, significant updates, or milestone versions

2. **Feature Reviews**: Focused reviews of specific features or components
   - Format: `.architecture/reviews/feature-name.md`
   - Used for evaluating individual features or components

3. **Specialized Reviews**: Reviews from specific architectural perspectives
   - Security, Performance, Maintainability, Domain, etc.
   - Conducted by specialized architecture roles

## Review Process

The review process follows these steps:

1. **Individual Member Review Phase**:
   - Each architecture member (from members.yml) reviews independently
   - Members focus on their specific areas of expertise
   - Document findings, recommendations, and concerns

2. **Collaborative Discussion Phase**:
   - Members confer on findings and discuss trade-offs
   - Prioritize recommendations and align on key issues
   - Identify cross-cutting concerns

3. **Final Consolidated Report**:
   - Create balanced perspective across all domains
   - Document findings, recommendations, trade-offs analysis
   - Suggest improvements with clear priorities

## Specialized Architecture Members

Reviews incorporate perspectives from specialized members defined in `.architecture/members.yml`:

- Systems Architects (overall system design)
- Domain Experts (business logic and domain modeling)
- Security Specialists (security concerns and vulnerabilities)
- Performance Experts (system performance and scalability)
- Maintainability Architects (code quality and long-term maintenance)
- AI Engineering Specialists (AI integration and optimization)
- Language/Framework Experts (language or framework-specific expertise)

## Using Reviews with Cursor

You can request specialized architecture reviews by using prompts like:

- "Review this architecture from a security perspective using AI Software Architect"
- "Conduct a performance review of this component using AI Software Architect"
- "Analyze this feature's architecture using the AI Software Architect framework"
