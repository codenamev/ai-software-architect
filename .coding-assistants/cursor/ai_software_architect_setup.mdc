# AI Software Architect Setup

This rule provides setup instructions for configuring the AI Software Architect framework in a project.

## Setup Recognition

Respond to these setup requests by following the setup process:

- "Setup ai-software-architect"
- "Setup architecture" 
- "Setup software architect"
- "Setup architect"
- "Customize architecture"

## Setup Process

When a user requests setup:

1. **Detect Setup Context**
   - Check if `.architecture/` directory exists with framework files
   - Verify running from user's project root (not within .architecture)
   - Confirm user has framework reference in their project configuration

2. **Analyze Target Project**
   - Examine current directory to understand the codebase
   - Identify programming languages, frameworks, and patterns
   - Check for existing documentation, package files, project structure
   - Look for technology-specific files

3. **Framework Installation**
   - Move framework from `.architecture/.architecture/` to `.architecture/`
   - Create `.coding-assistants/` directory structure
   - Set up initial directory structure for decisions, reviews, recalibration

4. **Customize for Project**
   - Update `.architecture/members.yml` with roles relevant to tech stack
   - Modify `.architecture/principles.md` for project's architectural needs
   - Customize templates in `.architecture/templates/` based on project patterns
   - Create initial ADR structure

5. **Cleanup & Finalize**
   - Remove template repository files (README.md, USAGE*.md, INSTALL.md)
   - Remove `.architecture/.git/` directory specifically
   - Remove empty cloned repository structure
   - Verify framework files are properly located

6. **Guide Next Steps**
   - Explain customizations made and reasoning
   - Show how to use framework with their specific project
   - Suggest immediate steps for architectural documentation
   - Provide examples relevant to their tech stack

## Configuration Files

When setting up, ensure these files are properly configured:

- `.cursorrules` - Include reference to framework rules
- `CLAUDE.md` - Add framework usage instructions (if present)
- `.architecture/members.yml` - Customize for project's needs
- `.architecture/principles.md` - Align with project architecture
