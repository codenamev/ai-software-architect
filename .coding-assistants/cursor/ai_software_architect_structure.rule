## Document Types

1. **ADRs** (.architecture/decisions/adrs/):
   - Lightweight documents that capture architectural decisions
   - Include context, decision, status, consequences, and alternatives

2. **Reviews** (.architecture/reviews/):
   - Version-based reviews (e.g., `1-0-0.md`) 
   - Feature-based reviews (e.g., `feature-name.md`)
   - Include multi-perspective analysis from different architecture roles

3. **Recalibration Plans** (.architecture/recalibration/):
   - Action plans for implementing review recommendations
   - Track progress on architectural improvements

4. **Principles** (.architecture/decisions/principles.md):
   - Core architectural principles guiding the project
   - High-level design philosophy and constraints

5. **Members** (.architecture/members.yml):
   - Defines architecture review team members
   - Each member has specialties, disciplines, and domains
