# AI Software Architect Framework

This rule provides guidance on using the AI Software Architect framework - a markdown-based system for implementing rigorous software architecture practices with AI assistant integration.

## Directory Structure

The AI Software Architect framework uses these key directories:

- `.architecture/` - The main container for all architectural documentation
  - `decisions/adrs/` - Contains Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
  - `decisions/principles.md` - Architectural principles document
  - `reviews/` - Holds architecture review documents
  - `recalibration/` - Contains plans for implementing architectural changes
  - `comparisons/` - Version-to-version comparisons
  - `templates/` - Templates for various document types
  - `members.yml` - Defines architecture review team members

- `.coding-assistants/` - Configuration for AI assistants to understand your architecture
  - Each assistant has its own subdirectory (claude, cursor, codex)

## Key Workflows

1. **Creating ADRs**: Document architectural decisions in `.architecture/decisions/adrs/`
2. **Architecture Reviews**: Conduct and document reviews in `.architecture/reviews/` using:
   - Version-based format (e.g., `1-0-0.md`) for version reviews
   - Feature-based format (e.g., `feature-name.md`) for feature reviews
3. **Recalibration**: Plan implementation in `.architecture/recalibration/`
4. **Specialized Reviews**: Get focused feedback from specific architectural perspectives

## Commands for Cursor Users

- "Review this architecture using AI Software Architect framework"
- "Create an ADR for [topic] following the AI Software Architect format"
- "Provide a security review for this code using the AI Software Architect framework"
