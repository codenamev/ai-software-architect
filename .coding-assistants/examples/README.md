# Examples Directory

This directory contains real-world project configuration examples showing how the AI Software Architect framework should be customized for specific technology stacks.

## Purpose

Examples demonstrate:
- **Technology-specific customization** of architecture members
- **Project-appropriate principles** and architectural guidance  
- **Framework command examples** tailored to the technology stack
- **ADR examples** relevant to the project type

## Available Examples

### `rails-project.md`
Complete configuration example for Ruby on Rails applications including:
- Rails-specific architecture member roles (Rails Architect, Ruby Expert, Database Architect)
- Rails conventions and principles (MVC, ActiveRecord patterns, service objects)
- Technology-appropriate command examples for each AI assistant
- Sample ADRs for Rails architectural decisions

## Using Examples

Examples serve as **reference material** for:

1. **Framework Setup**: Understanding how customization should work for different technology stacks
2. **Architecture Member Creation**: Seeing appropriate roles and expertise areas for specific technologies
3. **Principle Customization**: Learning how to adapt architectural principles to different project types
4. **Command Usage**: Understanding how to use framework commands effectively in context

## Example Structure

Each example includes:
- **Project Context**: Technology stack and architecture overview
- **Customized Members**: Technology-specific architecture team roles
- **Customized Principles**: Project-appropriate architectural guidelines
- **Command Examples**: How to use the framework with each AI assistant
- **ADR Examples**: Sample architectural decision records
- **Integration Points**: Key files and configurations the framework should reference

## Contributing Examples

When adding new examples:
- Choose significantly different technology stacks
- Include realistic architecture member roles
- Provide technology-specific principles
- Show practical command usage
- Include relevant ADR samples
