# Testing Directory

This directory contains testing procedures and verification guides to ensure AI coding assistants can successfully set up and use the AI Software Architect framework.

## Purpose

Testing files provide:
- **Setup verification procedures** for each AI assistant
- **Cross-assistant compatibility tests** to ensure consistent behavior
- **Technology-specific testing scenarios** for different project types
- **Success criteria and troubleshooting** for common issues

## Available Testing Files

### `setup-verification.md`
Comprehensive testing guide covering:
- **Claude Code testing**: Setup recognition, configuration, and customization tests
- **Cursor testing**: Rule file integration and command recognition tests  
- **GitHub Copilot/Codex testing**: Context recognition and natural language command tests
- **Cross-assistant compatibility**: Ensuring assistants work with each other's configurations
- **Technology-specific testing**: Rails, Node.js, and other project type verification

## Testing Categories

### Setup Tests
- Command recognition verification
- 6-step setup process execution
- Framework installation validation
- Configuration file creation

### Integration Tests  
- Assistant-specific configuration validation
- Rule file and context integration
- Command functionality verification
- Cross-assistant compatibility

### Technology Tests

- ADR reference capability
- Review process coordination

## Using Testing Files

### For Framework Development
- Verify new features work across all assistants
- Test configuration changes before release
- Validate cross-assistant compatibility
- Ensure consistent user experience

### For Quality Assurance
- Systematic testing of setup processes
- Verification of assistant capabilities
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Performance and reliability validation

### For Documentation
- Provide examples of expected behavior
- Document known issues and solutions
- Guide troubleshooting efforts
- Validate documentation accuracy

## Test Execution

Each test includes:
- **Prerequisites**: Required project setup or configuration
- **Test Command**: Specific command or action to test
- **Expected Result**: What should happen when the test succeeds
- **Verification Steps**: How to confirm the test passed

## Success Criteria

Tests verify:
- ✅ **100% Setup Success Rate**: Setup commands work consistently
- ✅ **Technology Detection**: Correct project type identification and customization
- ✅ **Command Recognition**: All documented commands function as expected
- ✅ **Cross-Compatibility**: Assistants work with others' configurations
- ✅ **Documentation Quality**: Generated content follows framework standards
